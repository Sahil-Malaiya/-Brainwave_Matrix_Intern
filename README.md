Internship Data Science & Data Analysis Tasks
This repository contains solutions to the tasks assigned during my internship, focused on data science and data analysis. These tasks demonstrate my skills in data preprocessing, analysis, visualization, and applying machine learning techniques.

Task 1: Sales Data Analysis
Objective:
Analyze sales data of a commercial store to extract meaningful insights about performance, trends, and customer behavior.

Key Steps:
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistent data formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze sales trends over time (daily, monthly, yearly).
Identify top-performing products, categories, and locations.
Study customer purchasing patterns.

Data Visualization:
Use bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps to visualize insights.
Present insights on sales revenue, peak periods, and product popularity.

Reporting:
Summarize findings in a clear and concise report.
Provide actionable recommendations for store management.

Skills Demonstrated:
Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python (pandas, NumPy).
Visualization using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Business-focused analysis to derive actionable insights.

Potential Insights:
Peak sales periods for better inventory management.
Best-selling products and categories for targeted marketing.
Regions with high revenue for potential expansion opportunities.

Task 2: Social Media Sentiment Analysis
Objective:
Analyze social media data (e.g., tweets) to understand public sentiment towards specific topics, products, or events. The analysis helps uncover trends and patterns in public opinion.

Key Steps:
Data Collection:
Gather data from platforms like Twitter using APIs (e.g., Tweepy).
Extract relevant fields like text, timestamp, and user metadata.

Data Preprocessing:
Clean text data by removing stop words, special characters, and URLs.
Normalize text (lowercasing, stemming, or lemmatization).

Sentiment Analysis:
Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiment.
Implement a sentiment scoring method (e.g., VADER or TextBlob).

Trend Analysis:
Visualize sentiment trends over time using line plots and area charts.
Identify periods with significant sentiment changes.
Visualization:

Word clouds for common keywords and hashtags.
Sentiment distribution graphs (positive, neutral, negative).

Skills Demonstrated:
Data extraction using APIs.
Text preprocessing with NLP libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy).
Sentiment scoring and analysis.
Trend visualization using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

Potential Insights:
Overall public sentiment towards a topic/product.
Key timeframes with significant sentiment shifts (e.g., during events or launches).
Common words and themes in user-generated content.
Tools and Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:
Data Processing: pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
NLP: NLTK, spaCy, TextBlob, VADER

Data Sources:
Sales data (Task 1): CSV/Excel files from commercial store systems.
Social media data (Task 2): Extracted using APIs like Tweepy (Twitter).

#Social Media Sentiment Analysis: Sample Output

1. Sentiment Distribution
Positive: 50 tweets (50%)
Neutral: 30 tweets (30%)
Negative: 20 tweets (20%)

2. Frequent Keywords
Common Words: "launch," "amazing," "features," "disappointed," "product."

3.Sentiment Trends Over Time

Insight:Positive tweets peaked on 2025-01-03 (product launch), while negative tweets increased slightly due to feedback issues on 2025-01-04.

4.Example Tweets
Positive: "Amazing product launch! Love the new features! #LaunchDay"
Neutral: "The product launch happened today. Interesting to see the response."
Negative: "Disappointed with the lack of innovation. Expected more. #Underwhelmed"
